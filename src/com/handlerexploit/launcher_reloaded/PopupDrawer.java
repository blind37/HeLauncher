	 * The current way that the app drawer works is we use the PopupWindow because it gives us the ability to control
	 * which animations we are going to use for fading in and out. The PopupWindow causes us some problems because
	 * we cannot override onBackPressed so we cant back out of it using the back button. It also causes problems
	 * when we are doing a onItemLongClick to drop a shortcut to the workspace, it wont let us add it directly to
	 * the current view parent so it cant handle the transition correctly. When I can find a better method that still
	 * allows us to control the animations with as much flexibility as the PopupWindow does I will switch over to it.
